I am a physicist through and through, with all that this entails. I grew up in the small town of Lugo di Romagna as a geeky kid with an (un)healthy obsession for science and technology. I was never an athlete, preferring to spend my free time reading random encyclopedias and playing videogames with my close friends. All this inevitably shaped my future, making me decide to move to Milan to pursue a degree in Physics, which I finally attained in June 2022.

It wasn't easy: I've always been a pretty good student, but nothing could have prepared me for the sheer amount of Maths that I had to digest over the course of my degree. This soon developed in a textbook case of Stockholm syndrome, making me become infatuated with Mathematics as I slowly began to understand its many nuances. Combining this newfound passion with my love and predisposition for science and technology, I went on to become a computational physicist, graduating with a dissertation on the geometric processing of data in deep neural networks.

While I now consider myself as mainly a data scientist, the degree in Physics surely had the greatest impact on my mindset, flexibility and problem solving capabilities, giving me all the tools needed to quickly adapt to changes and overcome many intellectual obstacles.

I treasure my passion for knowledge even more than my skills, because that's what stands behind every scientific discovery and technological breakthrough.
